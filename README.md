# Text Classification by using Naive-Bayes Classification Algorithm
It's a classification problem. Text categorization assigns an all text to a specific category from a finite set. 
Text categorizations may have some tasks as sentiment analysis, spam detection, language identification etc.
Naive Bayes is a model that uses bag of words method without importance of the positions of the words and assumption of conditional independence.
There are two techniques used there. One is bigram and other is unigram. Unigram takes every single word for once. Bigram takes every adcajent two words for once and generating a dictionary.
"sklearn" library used where it takes place in a counting the words and generating a dictionary for the whole context.
